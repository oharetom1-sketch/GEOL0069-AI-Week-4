# Sea-Ice abd Lead Unsupervised Classification
This projects utilises unsupervised machine learning technoques to discriminate sea ice and leads from satellite imagery. The satelite used to collect the data was the Sentinel-3 OLCI. This project will compare unsupervised classifications against ESA-provided ground truth products to evaluate model performance,

We will be using a two cluster approach implementing abd comparing:

- K-mean clusterin
- -Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

The project is developed and run entirely in google colab
